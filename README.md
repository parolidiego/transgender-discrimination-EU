# Analyzing support for transgender people rights in the EU
 
This repository contains the work done by Diego Paroli, Irene García-Espantaleón Artal, Bradley McKenzie, Candela Gómez Blanco for the group assignment of the Survey Research Methodology II course in the Master in Computational Social Sciences at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.

The assignment involved using Eurobarometer survey data along with country-level data to develop two models:

- An explanatory model (mixed model with cross level interactions) to analyze the factors influencing support for the right of transgender people to change their gender on civil documents.

- A predictive model to forecast support for this policy if introduced in additional countries.

The repository includes a fully replicable `.Rmd` file containing the complete analysis, all the necessary data to run it and a final version of the work rendered as an `.html` file. Additionally, it features a written report summarizing key steps of the projects plus our findings and a `.pdf` presentation of our work.
